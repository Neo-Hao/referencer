Referencer allows you to cross-reference figures, tables, and section titles using built-in Bookmarks in Google Docs. When the document is changed, all references can be synchronized and auto-numbered.

## Auto-number your section titles

Follow two simple steps to auto-number your section titles:

1. Format your section titles as headings.
2. Run "Auto-number headings" from the menu of Referencer.

Heading is a built-in style for titles in Google Docs. To enable auto-numbering of section titles, you need to firstly style them as headings. There are six levels of headings supported by Google Docs. If you need help with using headings in Google Docs, please visit [Docs Editor Help](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/116338?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop).

## Update references

Follow three simple steps to cross-reference your figures, tables, and section titles:

1. Insert a bookmark at the beginning of the title of a figure, table, or section title.
2. Insert a link in the main text where you want to reference the bookmark.
3. Run "Update References" from the menu of Referencer

Bookmarks are built-in functions in Google Docs. If you need help with using Bookamrks in Google Docs, please visit [Docs Editor Help](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop).

## Remove references

Follow one simple step to remove all cross-references:

* Run "Remove References" from the menu of Referencer

We understand that this may be necessary for important documents. However, please note that the removed cross-references have to be added back manually, if you remove references accidentally.

Referencer is an open-sourced software that allows you to cross-reference figures, tables, and section titles using built-in Bookmarks in Google Docs. When the document is changed, all references can be synchronized and auto-numbered.

## Auto-number your section titles

Follow two simple steps to auto-number your section titles:

1. Format your section titles as headings.
2. Run "Auto-number headings" from the menu of Referencer.

Heading is a built-in style for titles in Google Docs. To enable auto-numbering of section titles, you need to firstly style them as headings. There are six levels of headings supported by Google Docs.

## Update references

Follow three simple steps to cross-reference your figures, tables, and section titles:

1. Insert a bookmark at the beginning of the title of a figure, table, or section title.
2. Insert a link in the main text where you want to reference the bookmark.
3. Run "Update References" from the menu of Referencer

Bookmarks are built-in functions in Google Docs. If you need help with using Bookamrks in Google Docs, please visit [Docs Editor Help](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop).

## Remove references

Follow one simple step to remove all cross-references:

* Run "Remove References" from the menu of Referencer

We understand that this may be necessary for important documents. However, please note that the removed cross-references have to be added back manually, if you remove references accidentally.
